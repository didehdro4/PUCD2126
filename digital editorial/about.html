    <p class="content-center col col-8">Andy Yang was born in Seoul, South Korea in April 24th, 1996. Although his parents worked in the education industry, he never liked to study. He was one of the students that fucked around in class always got in trouble. He always had a thing against a boxed system and couldn't stand the Korean standardized education. He dropped out of highschool, studied and passed GED and somehow ended up in NewYork.</p>
    <p class="content-center col col-8">Andy never took photography seriously until he got to NewYork. As he quotes, "I started photography because I was never an artist. I got to Parsons only after painting 7 months and had no sense of art in me. Looking at all the other artists/students, I felt like I needed at least one skill that I can say I'm good at. And for some reason, it was photography".</p>
    <p class="content-center col col-8">"So that was it. There it was. From that moment till now, all my passion was about photogrphy. It started not becoming a hobby/skill, but instead it became a big part of my life".</p>
